# Hello friend!

## My name is Antonio Placido, I'm an aspiring web dev located in Montreal Canada, looking for new opportunities!

About Me
<p>I'm a fresh graduate out of a 12 week Bootcamp intensive from Concordia University. My itch to code started at my last job as a bank employee, dabbled a little bit into VBA and saw the magic of automating processes with scripts. My current skillset includes Javascript, React, Redux, Node, Firebase and MongoDB, and it's only the beginning!</p>

## So Whats up?

<p>I'm currently working on honing my skills as a dev, and I'm currently collaborating with 2 of my closest friends building apps together!</p>
