# Hello friend!

### My name is Antonio Placido and I'm an aspiring web dev located in Montreal Canada, looking for new opportunities!

<div>About Me</div>
I'm a fresh graduate out of a 12 week Bootcamp intensive from Concordia University. My itch to code started at my last job as a bank employee, dabbled a little bit into VBA and saw the magic of automating processes with scripts. My current skillset includes Javascript, React, Redux, Node, Firebase and MongoDB, and it's only the beginning!

### So Whats up?

I'm currently working on honing my skills as a dev, and I'm currently collaborating with 2 of my closest friends building apps together!

### For personal inquiries
